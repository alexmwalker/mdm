#About

MDM Consulting is about looking at things differently.  It is taking the different path to what has been done in the past.  It might be a simple tweak to an existing program that begins with “have you thought of…” or it could be a complete new program for the next evolution of your business.

My experience, in conjunction with an extensive information gathering and research component, provides a detailed overview of your issues leading to a comprehensive road map on how to proceed.  I can look at an existing plan, promotion or strategy and provide my constructive advice or develop a strategy from scratch that will clearly meet your objectives.

Having worked with some of the world’s leading brands including Bosch, King Gee, Hard Yakka and the Western Bulldogs, I am perfectly positioned to tackle any challenge you have and become a key partner to your business.
