description: The Western Bulldogs are one of 18 teams in the AFL and hold special place in the hearts of most AFL supporters, particularly people in Melbourneâ€™s west.  As General Manager of Commercial Operations I was responsible for generating $10m in revenue with key achievements being selling the naming rights to Whitten Oval and renewing major sponsors to club record dollars and tenure.
